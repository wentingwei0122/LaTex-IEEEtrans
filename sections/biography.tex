\section{Biography Section}
If you have an EPS/PDF photo (graphicx package needed), extra braces are
 needed around the contents of the optional argument to biography to prevent
 the LaTeX parser from getting confused when it sees the complicated
 $\backslash${\tt{includegraphics}} command within an optional argument. (You can create
 your own custom macro containing the $\backslash${\tt{includegraphics}} command to make things
 simpler here.)

\bf{If you include a photo:}\vspace{-33pt}
\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{fig/fig1}}]{Michael Shell}
Use $\backslash${\tt{begin\{IEEEbiography\}}} and then for the 1st argument use $\backslash${\tt{includegraphics}} to declare and link the author photo.
Use the author name as the 3rd argument followed by the biography text.
\end{IEEEbiography}

\vspace{11pt}

\bf{If you will not include a photo:}\vspace{-33pt}
\begin{IEEEbiographynophoto}{John Doe}
Use $\backslash${\tt{begin\{IEEEbiographynophoto\}}} and the author name as the argument followed by the biography text.
\end{IEEEbiographynophoto}
